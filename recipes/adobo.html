    <p>This is my family's favorite version of this Filipino classic dish. It's so easy to make and very flavorful, too. Try it for yourself - it's the ultimate chicken and pork adobo!</p>

    <h2><i>Ingredients: </i></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Bay Leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><i>Steps: </i></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken and pork pieces in a non-reactive bowl. Pour the marinade and ensure all the pieces are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pan. Saute the garlic and onion until aromatic and the onions have started to brown</li>
        <li>Depending on how big the pieces of meat are, cook the pork ahead for the first 8-10 minutes or until they've rendered their fat.</li>
        <li>If the sauce begins to dry up before the meat is tender (in my experience its never the case), simply add a little more water as needed. You can let the dish dry up if you prefer a dryer adobo otherwise, retain some liquid. Some prefer to fry the adobo which you may do after its cooked just brown it quickly.</li>
    </ol>
